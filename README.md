# hello-world
my first one

i'm here for a late life career change. i did this 20 years ago as a side duty for my job. i loved it and when it ended i didn't pursue it because i thought there was a huge knowledge and talent gap between me and the pros. it turns out I would have gotten better with experience just like any other job. but right now i have no idea what i am doing here.
